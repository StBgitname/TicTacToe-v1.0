# Tic Tac Toe with simple Reinforcement Learning algorithm

This is a small project to get acquainted with the Q-Learning algorithm.


## Features

- implemented console interface
- A human player can play against an AI agent.
- after each game, the AI stores the new Q-Values in a csv-file

## ToDo

- GUI
- training of the AI by a teacher agent
- compare Board states to account for mirrored and rotated states
  (This would greatly reduce the size of the stored data)
